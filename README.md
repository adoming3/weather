# Weather Project

Build a simple weather application in React. Limit your time spent on the project to 8 hours.

The user will see a list of cities from cities.json (City List) with a small summary of the current weather for each city. When the user initially goes to the page they will see the first city's 5 Day Forecast. 

The user can select a city from the City List to view the 5 Day Forecast for the selected city.

The user can filter the City List by multiple city names. 

The user can filter the City List by the current temperature ("temp"). The upper and lower scale of the temperature filter will be the greatest "temp_max" and lowest "temp_min" from the API results.

If the page is refreshed then the page will remember it's state for City List, Filters, and the 5 Day Forecast.

1. See the Weather-App-Mockup.png for an idea of the desired functionality. Design the layout and style as you see fit. We want to see your creative side!
2. Review the current weather for multipe city ids docs: https://openweathermap.org/current#severalid
3. Review the 5 day forecast docs: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#cityid5
4. Use API Key 480a3df3acbebf88f3edbf0663e5d40b
5. See cities.json for a list of cities 
6. Push the project to GitHub and include a ReadMe.md on how to deploy the application.
