# Weather Project

Build a simple weather application in React. Limit time spent on the project to 4 hours.

When the user initially goes to the page they will see the first city's 5 day weather forecast. The user will also see a list of cities (City List) with a summary of the current weather.

The user can select a city from the City List to view the 5 day forecast for that city.

The user can filter the City List by options in cities.json. If the page is refreshed then the page will remember it's state.

1. See the Weather-App-Mockup.png for an idea of the desired functionality. Design the layout and style as you see fit. We want to see your creative side!
2. Review the current weather for multipe cities docs: https://openweathermap.org/current#cities
3. Review the 5 day forecast docs: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5#cityid5
4. Use API Key 480a3df3acbebf88f3edbf0663e5d40b
5. See cities.json for a list of the top U.S. cities 
6. Push the project to GitHub and include a ReadMe.md on how to deploy the application.
